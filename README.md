# Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, and it evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Additionally, the decision tree is visualized for interpretability.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. You can find the dataset CSV file here:  
[Diabetes.csv - YBI-Foundation/Dataset](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/blob/main/Diabetes.csv)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

python diabetes_prediction.py
